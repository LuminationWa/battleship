// Your ‘ships’ will be objects that include their length, where they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.

// Ships should have a hit() function that takes a number and then marks that position as ‘hit’.
// isSunk() should be a function that calculates it based on their length and whether all of their positions are ‘hit’.
